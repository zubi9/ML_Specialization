# Learnings


- Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn, build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)


- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification, & build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods


- Apply best practices for ML development & use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning including clustering & anomaly detection


- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method & build a deep reinforcement learning model


# Machine Learning with Andrew Ng

Code is implemented in python of [Coursera's Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) (it uses Scikit-learn and NumPy). I also added some concepts and formulas that might be important to understand the algorithms.
